Hello, this is Max, the creator of this project. This calculator is something im making during my statistics class to help with reading graph data on csv files.

To use it, input the name of the csv file, along with .csv, e.g., data_1.csv, in the input and answer the question to get the desired data. The first upload only contains a frequency calculator.
However, a mean, mode, and median calculator will be included in the next major update.

The csv file attached is to be used as an example csv file for the user to get used to the program.
